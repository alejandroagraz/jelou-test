## Prerequisites for installation with docker-compose ⚙️

#### Docker Engine

##### Docker Installation On Linux
* [Docker For Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)

##### Docker Installation On Windows
* [Docker For Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

#### Docker Compose

##### Docker Compose Installation
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

#### Enabling Non-root Users to Run Docker Commands (Optional)
```diff
sudo groupadd docker
sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
newgrp docker

+ In the case of a virtual machine, it may be necessary to restart the virtual machine for the changes to take effect.

```

## Initialize (In the main directory run this /workspace)

```diff

+ Rename the file found in the root directory ./ example-env to .env

+ Go to directory the projects/backend-jelou directory and rename the file example-env to .env
    
+ Go to directory the /workspace and run the following commands from terminal
    docker-compose up -d
    docker-compose exec api-server `yarn run typeorm:generate-migration`
    docker-compose exec api-server yarn run typeorm:run-migrations
    docker-compose exec api-server yarn run seed
    
+ If during the compilation (docker-compose up -d) there is an error example: 
        ERROR: for server-yape-develop  UnixHTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=None): Read timed out. (read timeout=60))
            Please execute the following commands from the terminal:
                export DOCKER_CLIENT_TIMEOUT=220
                export COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT=220
    
+ When completing the previous steps we are ready to go to the browser to start using our application go to browser to url http://localhost:3000/auths/login
